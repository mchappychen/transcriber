1. Use brave cause it's faster (less cpu) than chrome. Can disable the annoying download shelf at the bottom in brave://flags

2. Get spellbee extension for auto-correct on otranscribe. You can import my typos to it from the .csv file

3. otranscribe.user.js makes otranscribe pad bigger, and adds hotkey to auto-capitalize lines (cmd+e on mac, idk windows)

3. When you run the python script, make sure all the packages (dependencies) are installed. (use pip). I'll make a list of all the packages here later and how to use the python script

4. I'll add a scribe tutorial for it. (scribe is cool)
