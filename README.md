1. Use brave cause it's faster (less cpu) than chrome. Can disable the annoying download shelf at the bottom in brave://flags

2. Get spellbee extension for auto-correct on otranscribe. You can import my typos to it from the .csv file. Dont forget to disable spellbee on other websites in its options

3. otranscribe.user.js makes otranscribe pad bigger, and adds hotkey to auto-capitalize lines (cmd+e on mac, idk windows). Tampermonkey extension needed

3. When you run the python script, make sure all the packages (dependencies) are installed. (use pip). I'll make a list of all the packages here later and how to use the python script

4. I'll add a scribe tutorial for it. (scribe is cool)
